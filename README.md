# toys

A repository of toys for stash files or synchronization in multiple place, which codes in  numerous langs.

You can ignore this repo most of the time. Because most of files just are testing or demo script on what I leaned, and some directries are organizae with no meaning and no rule. Maybe some test demo, which I just settup and don't know when to fullfill. So there are a bunch of semi-finish projects.

But if you rummage through it... Maybe can see a lot of funny or maybe useful  sample or test what made by me.
