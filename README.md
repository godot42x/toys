# toys

A repository of toys which for myself to stash temp files or synchronization in multiple places. This repo contains some codes in  multiple langs.

You can ignore this repo in most of the time. Because most of files here were just for testing or  practice's demo script about what I leaned, and some directries were not  organizaed with some meanings or specific rules. Maybe some test demo, which I just settup it once upon a time, and then just forgget to continue coding and didn't know when to fullfill it. So there are a bunch of semi-finish projects.

But if you rummage through it... Maybe can find seral funny things and should be considered as useful  sample or test that made by me.
